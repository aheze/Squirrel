# Squirrel

üêøÔ∏è‚ÄÇ*Pronounced: Scroll-Wheel*

A menu bar app that adds scrolling to the simulator.

- For some reason, you can't scroll in Xcode's simulator.
- This app enables scrolling again!
- Features: customizable settings, made with SwiftUI, and a cute squirrel.

## Installation

You can download Squirrel [directly](https://github.com/aheze/Squirrel/blob/main/Squirrel.zip), or use Homebrew.

```bash
brew tap hkamran80/things
brew install hkamran80/things/squirrel
```

**Note:** Squirrel requires macOS Ventura (13.0) or higher.

### How does it work?

Squirrel uses your Mac's accessibility controls to simulate a "drag" gesture.

### Apple, if you're reading this:

Please add native scroll support to the Simulator! Feels like such a small feature but it'll be very welcome.
